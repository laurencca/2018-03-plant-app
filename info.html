          <h3 class="underline">Native Plants</h3>
          <p>Plants native to the Pacific Northwest are some of the most attractive plants for gardens anywhere in the world. They include plants of all statures, from towering trees to creeping groundcovers. Many of the flowering shrubs are excellent choices for garden borders and wildlife gardens.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Pacific Northwest native plants can be used for a wide variety of landscape situations, including WaterWise gardens and borders.</p>

          <h3 class="underline">Water Conservation</h3>
          <p>Outdoor water use accounts for almost half the water used by the American home, and thus provides the greatest single opportunity for conserving.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Water early in the morning before 10:00 a.m.  Watering in the heat of the day allows the water to evaporate and watering late in the day may promote fungus and other lawn diseases.</li>
            <li>Depending on the weather, it’s generally better to water once a week and provide 1 inch to 1 ½ inches of water.  (If it’s hot, you might have to water more often.)</li>
            <li>Time how long it takes to apply one inch of water by placing a flat-bottomed can about 6-feet away from the sprinkler.</li>
            <li>Do not mow lawns too short; taller grass requires less water.  Consider letting your lawn brown out.  It will come back.</li>
